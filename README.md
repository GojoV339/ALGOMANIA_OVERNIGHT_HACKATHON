# Last Candle in the Castle (Godot Prototype)

A fast survival prototype built in Godot for the theme **"Last Candle in the Castle"**.

## Core idea
You are the final guardian inside a dark castle chamber. The candle at the center is hope itself. Keep it alive until dawn while shadows flood in from every side.

## Objective
- **Win:** survive until dawn (90 seconds).
- **Lose:** candle power reaches 0.

## Controls
- **Move:** `WASD` or arrow keys
- **Repel shadows:** hold `Space` (uses candle power)
- **Restart after win/loss:** `R`

## Mechanics tied to theme
- Candle power drains over time to simulate diminishing hope.
- Shadow enemies rush the candle and extinguish it faster.
- Wax pickups restore candle power, creating risk-vs-reward decisions.
- Dawn timer creates urgency and a clear ending.

## Run
1. Open the project in Godot 4.2+.
2. Press **Play**.
